This project has been a part of an academic research work for Course 'Pattern Recognition COMP-5013' in Masters in computer science from Lakehead University.

**Abstract**

"In recent years, most prominent technology to emerge was deep learning. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN or ConvNet) are the default deep learning model for image classification issues in computer vision and pattern recognition. One of the most recent and complicated benchmark dataset for image classification is Oracle-MNIST. It has unique noises and distortion in images which makes it challenging real world task to undertake. In this study, we analyzed Oracle-MNIST dataset with the help of data visualization, machine learning and deep learning techniques. We also propose a modified CNN architecture, which we explore further by cross validation to find optimal parameters. While machine learning models could achieve only 65\% accuracy in classifying the images, CNN achieved 94.97\% accuracy exceeding the previous 93.80\% accuracy achieved by the author of the Oracle-MNIST dataset."

One of the resultant Code notebook is given as [cnn-new.ipynb](https://github.com/niharika-sojitra/oracleMnist/blob/main/OracleMnist/cnn-new.ipynb), which has CNN model that has been used to get accuracy of 94.5.
